<title>Building IVE from Source</title>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="images/line.gif" width="90%"></p>

<p>To build IVE from source, you need to have a version of
<b>make</b> compatible with <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>. You
also need version 3.2.1 or greater of <a href=
"http://ngwww.ucar.edu/">NCAR Graphics library</a>,
a <a href=
"http://www.opengroup.org/tech/desktop/motif/">Motif library</a>
(which is included with most Unix OS), and the following public
domain libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=
"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> - version
3.3 or greater</li>

<li><a href=
"http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/udunits/">udunits</a> -
version 1.10.8 or greater</li>

<li>xgks - version 2.5.5 with UW modifcations<br>
(svn co https://www.atmos.washington.edu/svn/xgks-uw)</li>
</ul>

<p>The makefile assumes that the environment variable NCARG_ROOT has been set, 
the libraries have been installed in
/usr/local/lib, and that the include files are in
/usr/local/include. If they are in other locations you will have to
edit the config file accordingly. Architecture dependant config files are in the config directory.
You should examine the proper config file for your architechture prior to compiling.</p>

<p>IVE has at various times been successfully compiled from source for the following
systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sun 4 - SunOS 4.1.3</li>

<li>Sun - Solaris 2.5 and later with Sun unbundled compilers</li>

<li>DEC Alpha - Digital Unix 3.2C and later with DEC compilers</li>

<li>DEC MIPS RISC - Ultrix 4.3 with DEC compilers</li>

<li>SGI - IRIX 5.3 with SGI compilers</li>
<li>Debian Sarge</li>
<li>Debian Etch</li>
</ul>
<p>It is actively used on True64 Unix and Linux at the University of Washington.</p>

<p>If you have a bug, or you wish to contribute other platforms to
the IVE distribution, please send mail to <a href=
