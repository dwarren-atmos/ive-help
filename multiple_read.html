	<em>This command tells IVE that the data set may be spread over
multiple files with each file containing data at one point along
the specified coordinate.</em></h1>

<p><img src="images/line.gif" width="90%"></p>
</center>

<p>Widget:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the file selection widget described in <a href=
"file.html">FILE</a>. Click the button to specify the "file
coordinate" and then type in or select one of the files in the data
set. After double-clicking on the entry (or clicking on the OK
button) you will set a set of sliders showing the values of the
"file coordinate" that IVE found. You can set the sliders choose
any continuous subset of the files you would like. If you set the
start value greater that the finish value, the coordinate will be
used in IVE in descending order. When you are finished setting the
sliders, click on the OK button again to finish reading in the data
set information.</li>
</ul>

Command: 

<ul>
<li>MULTIPLE_READ=coordinate</li>

<li>MULTIPLE_READ=-coordinate</li>

<li>MULTIPLE_READ=coordinate,start,end</li>
</ul>

Arguments:

<ul>
<li>coordinate: is set to one of the following: 

<ul>
<li>"x", "y", "z", or "t", chooses the "file coordinate" along
which to recombine data that has been written in a series of
separate files. IVE checks if the current data file contains has
the current value of "coordinate" in its alpha-numeric name. If so,
IVE will look for other files in that directory whose names differ
from that of the current data file by only a numerical constant.
IVE will interpret the different numerical constants in this family
of data files as the set of available values for "coordinate", and
create a slider bar for this coordinate. Any any time a new field
is requested IVE will read the data for that field from the entire
family of individual files. (If the current data file name does not
contain the value of this coordinate then only the specified file
is read when a new field is requested.)</li>

<li>"none": turns multiple read off.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>start: the starting value of the file coordinate to use</li>

<li>end: the ending value of the file coordinate to use</li>
</ul>

If start and end are not specified, IVE will read in all available
files. If a "-" is in front of the coordinate value the files are
read in by decreasing values of the file coordinate, otherwise they
are read by increasing values. 

<p>If start and end are specified, IVE will only read files within
the specified range. If start &lt; end, then the files are read in
by increasing values of the file coordinate, otherwise they are
read by decreasing values. The "-" option should not be used to
reverse the ordering of the input files when start and end values
are specified.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>MULTIPLE_READ=t</li>
</ul>

In this example the multiple read coordinate is set to time.
Suppose you then set the current file to be
"/home/ive/data_1000_run.nc" using the widget or the <a href=
"file.html">FILE</a> command, and that file contained variable U
with a single time of value 1000. IVE will then look for other
files of the form "/home/ive/data_*_run.nc" that have time values
for "*". When you set the current field to "U" using the widget or
the <a href="field.html">FIELD</a> command, IVE will read the
values of U out of all of the proper files and act as if all the
time values of U were in one file. 

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>MULTIPLE_READ=z, 1000, 100</li>
</ul>

In this example the multiple read coordinate is set to Z. Suppose
you then set the current file to be "/home/ive/data_1000_run.nc"
using the widget or the <a href="file.html">FILE</a> command, and
that file contained variable U with a single Z of value 1000. IVE
will then look for other files of the form
"/home/ive/data_*_run.nc" that have z values for "*" in the range
of 1000 to 100. When you set the current field to "U" using the
widget or the <a href="field.html">FIELD</a> command, IVE will read
the values of U out of all of the proper files and act as if all
the Z values of U were in one file. Plots with a Z axis will have Z
decreasing along the axis.
