<h3>IVE Widgets:</h3>

The IVE widget interface consists of the IVE Main Window and the
Graphics Display Window that are both active throughout your IVE
session. The Graphics Display Window displays the most recent plot
and overlays that you generated. The IVE Main Window controls
program execution and activates additional task-specific widgets as
needed. 

<h3>Conventions:</h3>

When you use IVE there are "conventions" that hold true throughout
the IVE widgets. This section is to familiarize you with the two or
three different ways to perform an operation. The widgets are set
up this way so that you may choose the mode of execution most
convenient to you. 

<ul>
<li><b>Loading a File or Directory:</b> After you have highlighted
a file or directory there are three ways to load it: 

<ol>
<li>One way is to double click the file or directory with your
left-hand mouse button.</li>

<li>Another way is to strike the &lt;RETURN&gt; key on your
keyboard.</li>

<li>The third way is to single click on the box that is highlighted
in reverse video.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
</li>

<li><b>Clearing and Typing in a Box:</b> Whenever you wish to type
numbers and/or characters within a command box, you must activate
your keyboard within the box by clicking on it with the left mouse
button. The keyboard cursor then appears within the text at the
same location as the mouse cursor, and you are able to edit the
text as desired. 

<p>There are several ways to clear the box:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you activate your keyboard within the box, position your
mouse cursor at the far left of the text and click the left-hand
mouse button. Now when you begin typing, the contents of the box
are automatically erased.</li>

<li>If the mouse cursor is not at the far left when you click the
mouse button, it is still possible to clear the box. First, hold
down the &lt;CTRL&gt; key and strike A to bring your cursor to the
beginning of the box. Then, to erase all characters to the right of
the cursor, hold down the &lt;CTRL&gt; key and hit K.</li>

<li>You can also clear the box by holding down the left mouse
button and dragging the cursor along the text characters you wish
to erase. The highlighted text is automatically erased when you
begin typing.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
</li>

<li><b>Slider Bars:</b> There are three ways to adjust the settings
of Slider Bars:

<ol>
<li>One is to position the mouse cursor on the Slider Bar and drag
it to the desired setting by holding down the left mouse
button.</li>

<li>Another way is to click your left-hand mouse button just above
the Slider Bar, opening a small window in which to type the slider
bar setting. This method is handy for specifying an exact
value.</li>

<li>It is also possible to click your left-hand mouse button on
either side of the Slider Bar. With each click, the bar will move
incrementally in the direction of your cursor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Command Line:</h3>

The command line is the data entry box located at the bottom of the
IVE Main Window. Almost every widget manipulation can be performed
by typing an appropriate verbal command at the command line. These
commands are defined in the <a href="index.html">IVE Help
Index</a>. 

<p>To activate your keyboard within the command line, simply click
on it with the left mouse button and keep the mouse cursor within
the IVE Main Window. To clear the command line, hit the down arrow
key. To show the previous commands you typed, strike the up arrow
key as many times as needed.</p>
