<p>CALC_FIELD is an IVE <a href=
"transform_writing.html">transform</a> subroutine. By modifying
CALC_FIELD, you can link your own code to IVE in order to compute
diagnostic field variables other than the fields in the original
netCDF file. CALC_FIELD is especially useful for calculating fields
that will be used frequently or fields that are too complicated to
define at the IVE command line (see <a href=
"computations.html">Diagnostic Computations Using the Command
Line</a>).</p>

<p>The CALC_FIELD routine can be programmed in either C or Fortran
(To download the default transform package for IVE, refer to <a
href="transform_writing.html">Writing Transforms for IVE</a>). In
this document, we particularly focus on programming CALC_FIELD in
Fortran rather than in C, since Fortran requires the use of pointer
variables that allocate memory for field data storage. A number of
Fortran-callable IVE subroutines are available for calculating
diagnostic variables in CALC_FIELD. Among these subroutines, the
most important is <a href=
"transform_writing.html#getvar">GETVAR</a>. GETVAR returns a
pointer to the memory location where a specified diagnostic varable
is stored. It allows recursion within the CALC_FIELD routine such
that the data stored in one memory location may be calculated from
data stored in other memory locations. This makes GETVAR a powerful
tool. The following code is a sample Fortran version of CALC_FIELD
that demonstrates the use of the GETVAR routine:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">Following the above CALC_FIELD
declarations, you may insert the code for your own calculation. For
example, say you have temperature and pressure fields, and you want
to calculate the potential temperature: 

<center>THETA = T*(1000/P)**0.286</center>

<p>There are TWO ways to code the new field variable THETA in the
CALC_FIELD routine:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<h4>1. First Approach</h4>

The first approach is to pass GETVAR a mathematical expression
identical to that which could be entered directly on the IVE
command line using the <a href="field.html">FIELD</a> command (see
<a href="computations.html">Diagnostic Computations Using the
Command Line</a>).</div>
</div>

<pre>
c
      ibeg = strbeg(name)  ! These commands find the beginning and ending
      iend = strend(name)  !  characters in the variable "name".
      if (name(ibeg:iend) .eq. 'THETA') then
c
c     The following command returns a pointer to the memory location where
c     the field 'THETA' will be stored.  Note that it is necessary to use
c     IVE syntax in the mathematical expression for THETA.
c
          calc_field = getvar('T*(1000/P)^0.286', ndims, dims, stag, min,
     &amp;                      max, missing, data_units, data_display_units,
     &amp;              dim_names, flag)
          return
      endif
c
      return
      end ! CALC_FIELD
c
</pre>

<div style="margin-left: 4em">In this example,
"FIELD=T*(1000/P)^0.286, THETA" could have been entered at the IVE
command line to define the potential temperature field. However,
adding the above code to CALC_FIELD would enable IVE to
automatically recognize THETA as a diagnostic variable. Thus, the
CALC_FIELD subroutine allows you to streamline your IVE sessions
and avoid typographical errors in frequently evaluated functions.

<h4>2. Second Approach</h4>

Some field calculations are too complex to code at the IVE command
line. For example, performing a field variable integration would
require the user to loop through the array values. Such
manipulations are very involved and are only feasible by grabbing
the field variables and programming the calculations yourself. A
simple example of this second approach is shown below: (Again, we
will calculate THETA and we will assume that T and P are on the
same grid. If T and P were not on the same grid, it would be
necessary to interpolate the field values using the interpolation
operator '@' defined in <a href="computations.html">Diagnostic
Computations Using the Command Line</a>.)</div>

<pre>
c
      pointer t, p
      float pmissing
c 
      ibeg = strbeg(name)  ! These commands find the beginning and ending
      iend = strend(name)  !  characters in the variable "name".
      if (name(ibeg:iend) .eq. 'THETA') then
          p = getvar('P', ndims, dims, stag, min, max,
     &amp;               pmissing, data_units, data_display_units,
     &amp;               dim_names, flag)  !  Here, getvar returns a pointer
                       !   to the memory location where
                       !   the field 'P' is stored.
c 
          if (p .eq. 0) then  ! This 'if' loop flags user when 'P' missing  
              make_help_widget('THETA - cannot get P') 
              calc_field = 0
              return
          endif
c
c    Here, getvar returns a pointer to the memory location where the field
c      'T' is stored:
          t = getvar('T', ndims, dims, stag, min, max, missing,
     &amp;            data_units, data_display_units, dim_names, flag)
          if (t .eq. 0) then  ! This 'if' loop flags user when 'T' missing  
              make_help_widget('THETA - cannot get T')
              calc_field = 0
              return
          endif
c 
          num = dims(1) * dims(2) * dims(3) * dims(4)
          calc_field = getmem(num)  ! This command allocates array memory.
          if (calc_field .eq. 0) then  ! This 'if' loop flags user when
                           !  the memory cannot be allocated.
           make_help_widget('THETA - cannot allocate memory');
           calc_field = 0
               return
          endif
c 
          do i = 1, num
               t1 = r_val(%val(t), i)  ! These commands return the i-th 
               p1 = r_val(%val(p), i)  !  data value in the arrays p &amp; t
               if (t1 .eq. missing .or. p1 .eq. missing) then
c         If the i-th value in either p or t is missing, the
c         following command stores the value 'missing' in the
c         i-th value of the array THETA
c
                   call s_val(%val(calc_field), i, missing) 
c
               else
c         If the data is not missing, we calculate the i-th value
c         of the array THETA
c
                   call s_val(%val(calc_field), i, t1*(1000/p1)**0.286)
               endif
          enddo
          return
      endif
c      
      return
      end ! CALC_FIELD
c

<div style="margin-left: 4em">The second approach above grabs the
arrays P and T using the subroutine GETVAR. It then loops through
the arrays and computes THETA at each grid point. More complicated
diagnostic field computations are feasible with this
approach.</div>
