<title>Writing Transforms for IVE</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="images/line.gif" width="90%"></center>

<p>The "transform" subroutine library is the method for users to
link their own code into IVE. The transform routines handle such
things as array index to physical coordinate transformations and
the calculation of user-derived fields. Users need not supply IVE
with a complete set of customized transform routines; IVE will use
the default version of any transform subroutine that does not
appear in the user's package of customized routines. Customized
transform packages may be loaded automatically by setting the
environment variable 'IVETRANSFILE' to the full path name of the
file containing the customized transforms. Transform routines can
also be loaded at any time during an IVE session using the command
<a href="transform_file.html">TRANSFORM_FILE</a> .</p>

<p>The following is the list of standard transform subroutines that
may be called during an IVE session. The default IVE transform
package is available in both C and Fortran. To download the default
transform package, click <a href=
"ftp://ftp.atmos.washington.edu/ive/default.tar.Z">HERE</a>.</p>

<h2>IVE Transform Subroutines</h2>

<em>NEW_FILE</em> 

<blockquote>This routine is called every time a new file is read
in. IVE passes the routine the id of the open netCDF file. The
routine can then read any data or attributes off the netCDF file.
Quantities that are read by the default version of
<tt>`new_file'</tt> include the global attributes and the data in
coordinate variables. Customized versions of <tt>`new_file'</tt>
might read additional data fields such as an array of bottom
topography or auxillary data to be used in calculating derived
fields.</blockquote>

<em>NEW_FIELD</em> 

<blockquote>This routine is called every time a new field is
specified. Before calling <tt>`new_field'</tt> IVE reads in the
variable and its attributes IVE passes the routine the name of the
field, the data values and the dimensions of the data array. This
routine can be used to get and store the physical coordinate values
for use by the coordinate transform routines. This routine also can
be used to reorder the data array and dimensions.</blockquote>

<em>INDEX_2_PHYS</em> 

<blockquote>This routine is used to convert from array indices to
physical coordinates. IVE provides a vector containing the array
indices The routine should return the corresponding physical
coordinates.</blockquote>

<em>PHYS_2_INDEX</em> 

<blockquote>This routine is used to convert from physical
coordinates to array indices. IVE provides a vector containing the
physical coordinates. The routine should return the corresponding
array indices. A negative index indicates that this data point
should be assigned the missing value (e.g. a point under the
terrain) .</blockquote>

<em>HORIZ_TER</em> 

<blockquote>This routine is used to provide IVE with an array of
terrain heights for a horizontal cross-section. If you have no
terrain, this routine should return an array of
zeroes.</blockquote>

<em>VERT_TER</em> 

<blockquote>This routine is used to provide IVE with an array of
terrain heights for a vertical cross-section. If you have no
terrain, this routine should return an array of
zeroes.</blockquote>

<em>PHYS_2_LONLAT</em> 

<blockquote>This routine is used to convert from physical
coordinates to longitude-latitude coordinates for the purposes of
drawing maps. IVE provides a vector containing the physical
coordinates. This routine should return the corresponding
longitude-latitude coordinates.</blockquote>

<em>LONLAT_2_PHYS</em> 

<blockquote>This routine is used to convert from longitude-latitude
coordinates to physical coordinates for the purposes of drawing
maps. IVE provides a vector containing the longitude-latitude
coordinates. This routine should return the corresponding physical
coordinates.</blockquote>

<em>DEFAULT_MAP</em> 

<blockquote>This routine returns the map settings when the default
map is specified in IVE.</blockquote>

<em>DATA_SLICER_1D</em> 

<blockquote>This routine returns the computational points at which
a 1d slice should be taken. This is used if IVE cannot figure out
on its own which points to use. Normally, IVE will try to space
points evenly in computational space if possible. If data_slicer_1d
is not available, IVE will evenly space the points in physical
space.</blockquote>

<em>DATA_SLICER_2D</em> 

<blockquote>This routine returns the computational points at which
a 2d slice should be taken. This is used if IVE cannot figure out
on its own which points to use. Normally, IVE will try to space
points evenly in computational space if possible. If data_slicer_2d
is not available, IVE will evenly space the points in physical
space.</blockquote>

<em>DATA_SLICER_3D</em> 

<blockquote>This routine returns the computational points at which
a 3d slice should be taken. This is used if IVE cannot figure out
on its own which points to use. Normally, IVE will try to space
points evenly in computational space if possible. If data_slicer_3d
is not available, IVE will evenly space the points in physical
space.</blockquote>

<em><a href="calc_field.html">CALC_FIELD</a></em> 

<blockquote>This routine is used to give the user the ability to
compute their own derived fields. IVE provides the name of the
field requested by the user. The routine computes the derived field
and returns it.</blockquote>

<em>HEADING</em> 

<blockquote>This routine allows the users to change the main
headings on a plot.</blockquote>

<em>FILE_COORDINATE</em> 

<blockquote>This routine allows the users to change the current
value of the file coordinate used for reading a variable over
multiple files (see the <a href=
"multiple_read.html">MULTIPLE_READ</a> command and the section <a
href="data_format.html#multiple_files">"Splitting data into
multiple files"</a> in <a href="data_format.html">IVE Data
Format</a> for more details).</blockquote>

<em>Miscellaneous</em> 

<blockquote>Users may include any other routines they need as part
of the computations for the transform routines. If you start the
name of the routine, or any common blocks, with "t_", they will not
conflict with the name of any IVE external.</blockquote>

<h2>Calling IVE subroutines from the transforms</h2>

You may need to call IVE subroutines as part of the transforms. The
following is a list of useful routines (Fortran callable): 

<ul>
<li><a name="getvar"><strong>function getvar(var_name, ndims, dims,
stagger, phmin, phmax, missing, data_units, display_units,
dim_names, flag)</strong><br>
</a> This routine returns a pointer to the memory location where
the specified variable is stored. If it is not currently in memory
and it exists in the netCDF file, it is read into memory. If the
variable does not exist in the netCDF, getvar tries to calculate
it, which may involve a call to calc_field. The newly computed
variable will NOT have a button in the main IVE widget. Users
should be careful when using this routine in calc_field not to end
up in an infinite loop of calc_field calls. Several other pieces of
information about the variable are also returned in the arrays
ndims, stagger, min, max, missing, data_units, display_units and
dim_names.

</li>

<li><strong>function addvar(var_name, button_name, ndims, dims,
stagger, phmin, phmax, missing, data_units, display_units,
dim_names, flag)</strong><br>
 This routine is similiar to getvar. The difference is that a new
button with the name "button_name" is created if necessary, for the
variable "var_name". The calling sequence is the same as getvar,
with the additional parameter button_name:

</center>

<p>The corresponding routine <strong>setrarr</strong> stores named
IVE real array variables. The following are IVE real arrays that
may be of interest:</p>

<center>

</table>
</center>
</li>

<li><strong>getlvar(name, value, error)</strong><br>
 This routine gets the named IVE logical variables. The parameters
are: 

<center>
<table border="1">
<tr valign="top" align="center">
<td><b></b></td>
</tr>

<tr valign="TOP">

</center>

<p>The corresponding routine setlvar stores the named IVE logical
variable. The following are IVE logical variables that may be of
interest:</p>
</li>

<li><strong>read_from_nc</strong><br>
 Whether the last variable read in was read from the netCDF file or
was already in memory (or was a calculated field)</li>

<li><strong>make_help_widget(string)</strong><br>
 This routine pops up a window containing the specified character
string. This is used to display error messages to the user.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Programming considerations for writing transforms in
FORTRAN</h2>

Some of the routines above (for example read_var) deal with
pointers to arrays. Standard FORTRAN does not have a concept of
pointers. The Sun and DEC FORTRAN compilers have extensions that
allow primitive pointer manipulations. The problem is that FORTRAN
wants to deal with the arrays and variables themselves, not the
pointers. Getting to the object a pointer reference is called
"dereferencing a pointer". The method for dereferencing a pointer
"p" is to use the built in function "%val(p)". However, this
function can only be used in a subroutine or function call, i.e. 

<pre>
    call junk(%val(p))
</pre>

Subroutine "junk" can then work with the object to which p points.
If "p" points to an array, you should also pass to "junk" the array
dimensions for use by junk. As an example of this procedure,
examine at the FORTRAN version of the default transform discussed
below and see how a pointer to a 1D array is dereferenced in the
function "t_val". 

<h2>Examples</h2>

There are currently two examples of transforms. The first example
consists of the default transforms. The default transforms are
sufficiently flexible to handle several types of netcdf files. The
second example consists of the transforms to handle real time
Numerical Product grids from NMC. 

<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1: THE DEFAULT TRANSFORMS</strong></p>

<p>default.c and default.f are C and Fortran versions of the
default transforms. The default transforms and IVE can handle the
following types of <a href="data_format.html">netCDF files:</a></p>

<ul>
<li>A plain netCDF file with four dimensional arrays (C/netCDF
style A[nt,nz,ny,nx], Fortran style A(nx,ny,nz,nt)). In this case,
the physical coordinates are the array indices. The domain limits
are set to be the largest value of each dimension of the four
dimensional arrays, and the sliders will show the limits x: 1 to
nx, y: 1 to ny, z: 1 to nz, t: 1 to nt. If any dimension has a
value of 1, the slider for that dimension will not appear.</li>

<li>A netCDF file with four dimensional arrays and one dimensional
variables with the same name as the dimensions. In this case the
"dimension" variables are used to define the physical coordinates.
These "dimension variables" may be irregularly spaced. The domain
limits are set to be the values corresponding to the largest value
of each dimension of the four dimensional array. The file can also
contain a mix of dimensions matching this method and method 1
above.</li>

<li>A netCDF file with the following attributes defined ([] =&gt;
optional): 

<pre>
    Global: domxmin, domxmax [, x_units, x_display_units]
        domymin, domymax [, y_units, y_display_units]
        domzmin, domzmax [, z_units, z_display_units]
        domtmin, domtmax [, t_units, t_display_units]
<br>
     Per Field: xmin, xmax  [, units, display_units]
        ymin, ymax  [, units, display_units]
        zmin, zmax  [, units, display_units]
        tmin, tmax  [, units, display_units]
                [missing_data]
</pre>

The default transforms use linear interpolation to compute
transformations between physical space and array indices. Let xminB
and xmaxB denote the values of the "per field" attributes xmin and
xmax of the FORTRAN array B. Then B(i,?,?,?) will be plotted at the
x-location 

<blockquote>xminB + (i-1)*(xmaxB-xminB)/(nx-1)</blockquote>

with respect to the interval (domxmin, domxmax). The grid
intervals, delta_x, delta_y, delta_z and delta_t must be uniform in
order for the data to be displayed without distortion. 

<p>It is possible to mix the techniques for domain specification
discussed in examples 1-3 to describe the physical range of
different coordinates. For example, one could specify dom*min and
dom*max for x,y, and z and provide a one dimensional array listing
discrete values for t (i.e., specify t according to the preceding
method #2).</p>

<p>The following is an example of the header section of this third
type of netcdf file:</p>

<pre>
      
netcdf steep_c_hst {
dimensions:
    nx = 801 ;
    ny = 1 ;
    nz = 80 ;
    nxp1 = 802 ;
    time = UNLIMITED ; // (8 currently)

variables:
    float time(time) ;
        time:units = "s" ;
    float theta(time, nz, ny, nx) ;
        theta:units = "degK" ;
        theta:display_units = "degK" ;
        theta:xmin = 0.f ;
        theta:zmin = 50.f ;
        theta:xmax = 160000.f ;
        theta:zmax = 7950.f ;
        theta:missing_data = 9.9999994e+31f ;
    float p(time, nz, ny, nx) ;
        p:units = "Pa" ;
        p:display_units = "millibars" ;
        p:xmin = 0.f ;
        p:zmin = 50.f ;
        p:xmax = 160000.f ;
        p:zmax = 7950.f ;
        p:missing_data = 9.9999994e+31f ;
    float u(time, nz, ny, nxp1) ;
        u:units = "m/s" ;
        u:display_units = "m/s" ;
        u:xmin = -100.f ;
        u:zmin = 50.f ;
        u:xmax = 160100.f ;
        u:zmax = 7950.f ;
        u:missing_data = 9.9999994e+31f ;
    float w(time, nz, ny, nx) ;
        w:units = "m/s" ;
        w:display_units = "cm/s" ;
        w:xmin = 0.f ;
        w:zmin = 0.f ;
        w:xmax = 160000.f ;
        w:zmax = 7900.f ;
        w:missing_data = 9.9999994e+31f ;

// global attributes:
        :domxmin = 0.f ;
        :domzmin = 0.f ;
        :domxmax = 160000.f ;
        :domzmax = 8000.f ;
        :x_units = "m" ;
        :z_units = "m" ;
        :x_display_units = "km" ;
        :z_display_units = "km" ;

data:

 time = 300 , 600 , 900 , 1200 , 1500 , 1800 , 2100 , 2400 ;
}
</pre>

In this example, the sliders will show the limits x : 0 to 160
(km), y : no slider, z: 0 to 8 (km), t:300 to 2400 (sec). The
y-coordinate slider is omitted because ny=1 (in which case domymin
and domymax, although they may be specified in the netcdf file, are
irrelevant). The t-coordinate slider is specified according to the
technique in example two. 

<p>Note also that the "dimensions" section of the preceding netcdf
header contains the additional parameter nxp1, which is used to
increase the first (FORTRAN) dimension of the variable "u" by 1
with respect to the other variables. As evident from the "per
variable" values of xmin and xmax, the data in the array "u" are
staggered 100 m along the x-coordinate with respect to the data in
the arrays "theta", "p" and "w". The "w" array is also staggered 50
m along the z-coordinate with respect to the data in the arrays
"theta", "p" and "u".</p>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>EXAMPLE 2: TRANSFORMS FOR NMC GRIDS</strong> 

<p>nps.c is the transform used to handle the real time (HDS/NPS)
grids from NMC. The extra features in these transforms are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The forecast time (frtime) dimension/variable is not sorted.
The transform sorts frtime, returns the correct limits for that
dimension, and reorders the variables read from the netCDF so they
are in time increasing order.</li>

<li>Some fields are 3 dimensional: longitude, latitude and frtime.
IVE requires fields to have the following dimensions: x, y, z, t.
The transforms supply the missing vertical coordinate with a
dimension of one, which tells IVE that it is missing.</li>

<li>Interpolations in the vertical are done in log P rather than
linear P.</li>
</ul>
