<p>IVE (Interactive Visualization Environment) is a software
package designed to interactively display and analyze gridded data.
IVE assumes the data to be displayed are contained in one-, two-,
three- or four-dimensional arrays. By default, the numbers within
these arrays are assumed to represent grid point values of some
field variable (such as pressure) on a rectangular evenly spaced
grid. IVE is, nevertheless, capable of displaying data on arbitrary
curvilinear grids.</p>

<p>If the data points are not evenly spaced on a rectangular grid,
IVE must be informed of the grid structure, either by specifying
"attributes" in the data input or by specifying the coordinate
transform in a user supplied subroutine. Stretched rectangular
grids (which occur when the stretching along a given coordinate is
a function only of the value of that coordinate) can be
accommodated by specifying one-dimensional arrays containing the
grid-point locations along the stretched coordinate as part of the
IVE input data. Staggered meshes can also be accommodated by
setting "attributes" in the input data. The structure of more
complicated curvilinear grids must be communicated to IVE via user
supplied "transforms," which define the mapping between physical
space and the array indices.</p>

<p>Since four-dimensional data cannot be directly displayed on a
flat computer screen, it is necessary to reduced the dimensionality
of the data before it is displayed. One of IVE's primary
capabilities involves dimension reduction or "data slicing." IVE
allows the user to display lower-dimensional subsets of the data by
fixing a coordinate or by averaging over the coordinate.</p>

<p>IVE currently has the capability to display</p>

<ul>
<li>scalar fields as 

<ul>
<li><a href="2d_plots.html">2D scalar plots</a></li>

<li><a href="1d_plots.html">1D scalar plots</a></li>

<li><a href="skewt.html">vertical soundings</a></li>

<li>a single point value</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>vector fields as <a href="vector_plots.html">2D vector
plots</a></li>
</ul>

<p>IVE lets you overlay plots, loop plots, and control a wide
variety of display parameters.</p>

<p>IVE also can perform algebraic computations on the gridded data
and can calculate derivatives. More complicated computations can be
performed in user supplied subroutines.</p>
