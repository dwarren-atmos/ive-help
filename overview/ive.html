	s<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.YKRY5D.2">OVERVIEW</a></h1>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.YKRY5D.3">Welcome</a> to IVE
(Interactive Visualization Environment). IVE is a software package
designed to interactively display and analyze gridded data. IVE
assumes the data to be displayed are contained in one-, two-,
three- or four-dimensional arrays. By default, the numbers within
these arrays are assumed to represent grid point values of some
field variable (such as pressure) on a rectangular evenly spaced
grid. IVE is, nevertheless, capable of displaying data on arbitrary
curvilinear grids. 

<p>If the data points are not evenly spaced on a rectangular grid,
IVE must be informed of the grid structure, either by specifying
"attributes" in the data input or by specifying the coordinate
transform in a user supplied subroutine. Staggered meshes and
stretched rectangular grids (which occur when the stretching along
a given coordinate is a function only of the value of that
coordinate) can be accomodated by specifying "attributes" and
one-dimensional arrays containing the coordinate locations as part
of the IVE input data. More complicated mesh geometries must be
communicated to IVE via user supplied "transforms" that define the
mapping between physical space and the array indices.</p>

<p>Since four-dimensional data cannot be directly displayed on a
flat computer screen, it is necessary to reduced the dimensionality
of the data before it is displayed. One of IVE's primary
capabilities involves dimension reduction or "data slicing." IVE
allows the user to display lower-dimensional subsets of the data by
fixing a coordinate or by averaging over the coordinate.</p>

<p>IVE currently has the capability to display</p>

<ul>
<li>scalar fields as 

<ul>
<li>2D-contour plots</li>

<li>1D-line plots</li>

<li>a vertical sounding</li>

<li>a single point value</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>vector fields as 2D vector plots</li>

<li>trajectories in a 2D flow</li>

<li>trajectories in a 3D flow that are projected onto a plane
parallel to one of the cooridinate axes</li>
</ul>

<p>IVE lets you overlay plots, loop plots, and control a wide
variety of display parameters.</p>

<p>IVE also can perform algebraic computations on the gridded data
and can calculate derivatives. More complicated computations can be
preformed in user supplied subroutines.</p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.ZKRY5D.4">When</a> you begin IVE its
two most important windows will appear: the IVE WINDOW, and the
graphic display window. The IVE WINDOW will appear in the upper
left-hand corner of your screen, as seen below:</p>

<p><a href="graphics/iveAu29.gif"><img src=
"graphics/iveAu29th.gif"></a></p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.ZKRY5D.5">And</a> the graphic display
window is presented in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.
It is initially used as IVE's title page.</p>

<p><a href="graphics/iveAu28.gif"><img src=
"graphics/iveAu28th.gif"></a></p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.ZKRY5D.6">Most</a> of IVE's commands
are initiated from the IVE WINDOW. The IVE WINDOW is used to input
data sets, output data, plot data, create loops, and controls
several esthetic aspects, such as: color tables and line types.
Each feature of the IVE WINDOW will be discussed in detail.</p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.ZKRY5D.7">The</a> graphic display
window is where data is graphically depicted.</p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.ZKRY5D.8">The</a> second most
important control window is the WINDOW/SLICER window, which will
appear in the lower left-hand corner of your screen, <i>after you
have loaded your data.</i> As seen below:</p>

<p><a href="graphics/iveAu12.gif"><img src=
"graphics/iveAu12th.gif"></a></p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.0LRY5D.9">The</a> WINDOW/SLICER
window is used to select the portion of your data-set that you wish
to graphically depict. IVE plots portions of a four-dimensional
data set which represents points, lines, or surfaces. (The ability
to plot three-dimensional volumes will soon be added to IVE). Each
feature of the WINDOW/SLICER window is discussed in the section
titled `WINDOW/SLICER'.</p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.0LRY5D.A">The</a> third most
important control window is the PROPERTIES window:</p>

<p><a href="graphics/iveAu11.gif"><img src=
"graphics/iveAu11th.gif"></a></p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.0LRY5D.B">The</a> content of the
PROPERTIES window will vary, depending on the dimensions of the
data specified in the WINDOW/SLICER window. The PROPERTIES window
appears automatically, below the IVE WINDOW, after the
WINDOW/SLICER settings have reduced the original data set to a line
or a surface of data. Each feature of the PROPERTIES window is
discussed in the section titled `PROPERTIES'.</p>


	s<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.1LRY5D.D">CONVENTIONS</a></h1>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.1LRY5D.E">When</a> you use IVE there are
"conventions" that hold true throughout the IVE widgets. This
section is to familiarize you with the two or three different ways
to perform an operation. The widgets are set up this way so that
you may choose the mode of execution most convenient to you. 

<h2><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.1LRY5D.F">LOADING</a> A FILE OR
DIRECTORY:</h2>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.1LRY5D.G">After</a> you have highlighted
a FILE or DIRECTORY there are three ways to load your information:
1) You can double click the FILE or DIRECTORY with your left-hand
mouse button. 2) You can strike the RETURN key on your keyboard. 3)
You can single click on the box that is highlighted in reverse
video. 

<h2><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.2LRY5D.H">CLEARING</a> AND TYPING IN
A BOX:</h2>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.2LRY5D.I">Whenever</a> you wish to type
numbers and/or characters within a command box there are three
"conventions" that will hold true throughout IVE: 1) In order to
activate your keyboard within the box, you must move your mouse
cursor into the box. 2) If there are already numbers or characters
written within the box you are able to clear the box by holding
down the CONTROL key and striking A; this brings your cursor to the
head of the box. Then, to clear the box, hold down the CONTROL key
and hit K. The box is now free and clear and ready for you to enter
your next set of numbers or characters. 

<h2><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.2LRY5D.J">SLIDER</a> BARS:</h2>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.3LRY5D.K">There</a> are three ways to
adjust the settings of SLIDER BARS: 1) You can hold down your
left-hand mouse button on the SLIDER BAR and drag it to the desired
setting. 2) You can click your left-hand mouse button just above
the SLIDER BAR; opening a small window in which to type your
setting. 3) You can click your left-hand mouse button on either
side of the SLIDER BAR; with each click the BAR will move
incrementally in the direction of your cursor.

FILE</h2>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.4LRY5D.Q">If</a> the coordinate surfaces
of your data are curved, you must first supply IVE with a TRANSFORM
FILE. Transforms map your curvilinear coordinates to a rectangular
Cartesian grid. You have the option to set up a .cshrc file, which
automatically loads your transforms, but if you have not, you can
load your transform file via IVE. 

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.5LRY5D.R">After</a> you have brought
up the INPUT submenu, click the left-hand mouse button on the line
that reads: LOAD TRANSFORM. The TRANSFORMS window will appear, and
your default transforms are automatically displayed, in the
right-hand box labeled FILES.</p>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.MORY5D.72">Once</a> you have loaded your
data as a plot, you can build a loop with IVE. A loop is a series
of frames, each slightly different than the next. The level at
which each frame differs from another is determined by you--within
parameters of your data. Once you have created a loop you are able
to either toggle through the loop frame by frame with the STEP
arrows, or RUN it as a movie with varying speeds and directions. 

<h2><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.NORY5D.82">TO</a> LOAD A LOOP:</h2>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.NORY5D.92">To</a> load a loop, click on

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.SRRY5D.F2">You</a> are now presented
with three command line boxes: START VALUE, INCREMENT, and END
VALUE. START VALUE lets you decide, numerically, the start point of
your loop within your fixed coordinate (displayed below in the
WINDOW/SLICER widget). 

<h2><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.TRRY5D.G2">END</a> VALUE:</h2>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.TRRY5D.H2">END</a> VALUE allows you to
choose the end point of your loop, within the parameters of your
coordinate (as viewed in the WINDOW/SLICER widget). 

<h2><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.TRRY5D.I2">INCREMENT:</a></h2>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.TRRY5D.J2">The</a> INCREMENT box
determines how the coordinate is broken up to produce each frame
within your loop. For example, if you set START VALUE at 100, and
END VALUE at 1000, and you type 100 in the INCREMENT box, your loop
will consist of 10 frames. You have told IVE, through the INCREMENT
box, to create one frame for every 100 increments. 

<h2><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.TRRY5D.K2">GO:</a></h2>

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.TRRY5D.L2">After</a> you have

<a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.2SRY5D.C3">After</a> you have loaded
your data, a series of diamond icons appear at the bottom of the
IVE WINDOW--these represent your FIELDS: 

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.2SRY5D.D3">When</a> you created your

your data set; P for pressure, and so on. IVE can accommodate up to
99 different FIELDS.</p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.3SRY5D.E3">To</a> select a FIELD
click the left-hand mouse button on the small diamond that you wish
to activate. The program will ask you to wait until it is done. You

<p></p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.4SRY5D.I3">Each</a> slider bar
represents a single coordinate. The slider bars have two functions:
they allow you to fix a coordinate value, and they enable you to
select values for each of the coordinates.</p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.CVRY5D.J3">First,</a> you must FIX at
least one of the coordinate values. It is necessary to FIX at least
one coordinate because a plot is a two-dimensional representation
of a three or four-dimensional field. Example, if you created your
data in three plans: X, Y, and Z, and you FIX the Z-plan at a
setting of 3; you will get a picture of your X and Y plans as a
slice at Z = 3.</p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.CVRY5D.K3">To</a> FIX a value, click
your left-hand mouse cursor on the box that lies at the end of each
slider bar. Before you click on the box it will read FREE, click
once and it will read FIXED, click a second time and the box will
say AVERAGE (this averages the numerical values of the coordinate
to give you a single point), click on it once more and you will be
back at the FREE setting. Once you have fixed the desired
coordinate, or coordinates--because you can FIX more than
one--select values for each of your coordinates.</p>

<p><a name="0.2.5EVE6C.98QNFQ.CVRY5D.L3">To</a> select values,
place your mouse cursor on the slider bar, hold down the left-hand
mouse button, and drag it until you have your desired value. As you
slide the bar, the coordinate value is displayed numerically above
it. You can also select values via your keyboard. To do this, place
the mouse cursor above the slider bar and click the left-hand
button. This will open a small window in which you can type in the
desired value. This is helpful to select a precise point within a
coordinate with a large value.</p>
