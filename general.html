	sIVE General Help</h1>

<hr>
Most of IVE's commands are initiated from the IVE WINDOW. The IVE
WINDOW is used to input data sets, output data, plot data, create
loops, and controls several esthetic aspects, such as: color tables
and line types. Help on each feature is avaiable from the <a href=
"index.html">index</a>. 

<p>The second most important control window is the WINDOW/SLICER
window, which will appear in the lower left-hand corner of your
screen, <i>after you have loaded your data</i>.</p>

<p>The WINDOW/SLICER window is used to select the portion of your
data-set that you wish to graphically depict. IVE plots portions of
a four-dimensional data set which represents points, lines, or
surfaces. (The ability to plot three-dimensional volumes will soon
be added to IVE).</p>

<p>The third most important control window is the PROPERTIES
window:</p>

<p>The content of the PROPERTIES window will vary, depending on the
dimensions of the data specified in the WINDOW/SLICER window. The
PROPERTIES window appears automatically, below the IVE WINDOW,
after the WINDOW/SLICER settings have reduced the original data set
to a line or a surface of data.</p>

	sCONVENTIONS</h1>

When you use IVE there are "conventions" that hold true throughout
the IVE widgets. This section is to familiarize you with the two or
three different ways to perform an operation. The widgets are set
up this way so that you may choose the mode of execution most
convenient to you. 

<h2>LOADING A FILE OR DIRECTORY:</h2>

After you have highlighted a FILE or DIRECTORY there are three ways
to load your information: 1) You can double click the FILE or
DIRECTORY with your left-hand mouse button. 2) You can strike the
RETURN key on your keyboard. 3) You can single click on the box
that is highlighted in reverse video. 

<h2>Clearing and typing in a box</h2>

Whenever you wish to type numbers and/or characters within a
command box there are three "conventions" that will hold true
throughout IVE:

<ul>
<li>1) In order to activate your keyboard within the box, you must
move your mouse cursor into the box.</li>

<li>2) If there are already numbers or characters written within
the box they automatically be removed upon typing. To avoid this,
first click your left mouse button in the box where you would like
to begin typing.</li>

<li>3) All text boxex conform to "emacs keystrokes" 

<ul>
<li>Control_a is beginning of line</li>

<li>Control_e is end of line</li>

<li>Control_b is back one character</li>

<li>Control_f is forward one character</li>

<li>DELETE is Delete back one character</li>

<li>Control_d Delete forward one character</li>

<li>Control_k Delete to end of line</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Slider bars</h2>

There are three ways to adjust the settings of SLIDER BARS: 1) You
can hold down your left-hand mouse button on the SLIDER BAR and
drag it to the desired setting. 2) You can click your left-hand
mouse button just above the SLIDER BAR; opening a small window in
which to type your setting. 3) You can click your left-hand mouse
button on either side of the SLIDER BAR; with each click the BAR
will move incrementally in the direction of your cursor. 

<h2>Commands</h2>

Commands are entered as COMMAND=VALUE, where COMMAND is any valid
command, and VALUE is a modifier (or several modifiers separated by
commas) for the command. Commands may be entered in either upper or
lower case, and only as much of the command string needed to make
it unambiguous needs to be entered. Commands may also be entered
using various toggle buttons, radio buttons, and type-in boxes.
When all desired commands have been entered, the PLOT command will
produce a plot.
