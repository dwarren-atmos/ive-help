	<em>This command is used to select a field to be plotted from
the current data file.</em></h1>

<p><img src="images/line.gif" width="90%"></p>
</center>

<p>Widget:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a data <a href="file.html">FILE</a> is opened, buttons
appear at the bottom of the main widget and are labeled with the
field names. This allows for any field to be selected by clicking
with the left mouse button. 

<p>Additional field buttons may be added to the IVE Main Window
using the FIELD command. When a field is defined at the command
line, that field is calculated and a button appears. The new field
can subsequently be selected by merely clicking on the button.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Command: (Two possible formats exist) 

<ul>
<li>FIELD = field_name</li>

<li>FIELD = expression, name</li>
</ul>

Arguments : 

<ul>
<li>field_name: valid choices for field_name are either the name of
a field variable or a diagnostic variable that the user has made
provision to calculate either at the <a href=
"computations.html">command line</a> or in <a href=
"calc_field.html">CALC_FIELD</a> which is a subroutine of the <a
href="transform_writing.html">transform file</a>.</li>

<li>expression: a mathematical expression in terms of the existing
field variables or diagnostic variables (see <a href=
"computations.html">Diagnostic Computations Using the Command
Line</a>).</li>

<li>name: the name of the new field variable defined by the
expression</li>
</ul>

Examples : 

<ul>
<li>FIELD=T</li>

<li>FIELD=A*B/C, X<br>
 produces a new field called "X" which represents the result of the
expression A*B/C</li>

<li>FIELD=VORT<br>
 where "VORT" is a diagnostic variable which represents the
vorticity field</li>
</ul>

Notes : 

<ul>
<li>In the case of staggered grids such as U and P, one may use the
expression (U@P), where the value of U is linearly interpolated to
the P grid (See also <a href="computations.html">Diagnostic
Computations Using the Command Line</a>).

<center>EXAMPLE: FIELD=(U@P)*(W@P), UW</center>
</li>

<li>When a field from the data file is read in, it is read into
memory and stays in memory until either a new data file is opened,
or memory is freed using the <a href="free.html">FREE</a>
command.</li>
</ul>
