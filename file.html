<p>Widget:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select "Data File" from the "File" menu A file selection widget
will appear. You will see boxes for the current file filter, the
subdirectories of the directory specified by the file filter, and
the files specified by the file filter. There is also a type-in box
if you want to type in your commands. To use the file filter, move
the mouse pointer to the Filter type-in box, and type in your
choice. Press &lt;RETURN&gt; after you have finished typing. You
can use the filter to screen out all but the files that you prefer
to see. For example, if your data files all are of the form
model_1000.dat, you can set the filter to screen out all other
files by using model*.dat as the filter. To select a directory or
file, move to the appropriate box and double-click on your
selection. If needed, use the horizontal or vertical scroll bars.
Note that as you change the filter or select new directories or
file names, the changes are reflected in the Selection type-in box.
